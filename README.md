# Effortless Fabric
[Effortless Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/effortless-fabric) is a fabric version of [Effortless Building](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/effortless-building).
This mod implements most features from Effortless Building, but removed randomizer bag and reach upgrade items to make it a pure vanilla compat one.

## Building

Hold ALT key to switch build modes in the radial panel. There are buttons for undo/redo, modifier settings and replace modes on the left. The options for each build mode (like a filled vs hollow wall) are on the right.

### Build Modes

- **Disable**: Place in vanilla way
- **Single**: Place single block
- **Line**: Place lines of blocks in any 3 axis
- **Wall**: Place walls with locked x or z axis
- **Floor**: Place floor with locked y axis
- **Diagonal Line**: Place freeform lines of blocks

- **Slope Floor**: Place slopes at any angle
- **Cube**: Place cubes with 3 clicks
- **Circle**: Place blocks in a circle (ellipse)
- **Cylinder**: Place a cylindrical shape like a tower
- **Sphere**: Place a spheroid made of cubes

### Build Modifiers

- **Mirror**: Place blocks and their states in mirror, works with even and uneven builds.
- **Array**: Copies builds and block states in a certain direction a certain number of times.
- **Radial Mirror**: Places blocks in a circle around a certain point. The circle can be divided into slices, and each slide will copy your block placements.

### Replace Modes
